# World Happiness Report


The annual World Happiness Report has been published since 2012, and it ranks 150+ countries by how happy their citizens perceive themselves to be. The report looks at six key variables that affect the happiness scores: income, freedom, trust in government, healthy life expectancy, social support from family and friends, and generosity.

In this project, my goal is to analyze the happinness scores for the years 2015, 2016, and 2017 and find out what factors affect the scores the most, and what regions and countries rank the highest in their perception of happiness.
